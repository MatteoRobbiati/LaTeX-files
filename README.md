### LaTeX files' collection

Here some slides, notes and documents are collected. 
There are no rules about topics or folder's organization: with time I will update
this repo adding all my LaTeX productions. You will find more precise explanation
about the projects in their proper `README.md` files. 

### How to compile these files

You can clone the repo, then enter the desired folder and run `pdflatex main.txt`. 
Let's check if you have installed the latest `pdflatex` package.
